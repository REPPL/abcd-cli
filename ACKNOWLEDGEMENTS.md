# Acknowledgements

abcd stands on ideas, tools, and writing from many sources. This file records them
in three parts: the **development** that built abcd, the **inspirations** that
shaped its design, and the **references** it draws on. Each entry is added in the
same change that lands what it records — the pull request that adopts a pattern,
cites a source in an ADR, or integrates a tool — so the list grows with the work
rather than being reconstructed later. Runtime dependencies are not listed here;
they live in `go.mod` and the licence notices they carry.

## Development

Development of abcd has been assisted by Claude Code (Anthropic). Per-commit
disclosure uses an `Assisted-by:` trailer; the human contributor is the author of
record and is responsible for all AI-assisted output — its correctness, licensing,
and fit for the project. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Inspirations

Ideas and methodologies that shaped the design — not code abcd depends on.

- **The International Code of Signals (International Maritime Organization)** —
  the maritime flag alphabet whose Alfa, Bravo, Charlie and Delta are encoded
  pixel-for-pixel as abcd's logo (itd-133, `internal/livery`): the halved
  white-and-blue swallowtail, the all-red swallowtail, the five-stripe and the
  three-band flags. The full-size logo is held to the standard's geometry by
  test; the compact variant declares itself an approximation rather than
  claiming a fidelity three rows cannot carry.
- **The NO_COLOR convention (<https://no-color.org>)** — the environment
  variable that asks a program to emit no colour, and specifically its rule
  that the variable counts when *present and not empty*, whatever its value.
  That rule is what abcd's colour ladder implements (itd-112,
  `internal/term`), and the precedence test pins the empty-string case that a
  presence-only reading would get wrong.
- **"20 Must-Know Agentic AI Terms" (Andreas Horn, LinkedIn, 2026)** — the
  practitioner term list whose assessment seeded the terminology crosswalk
  (itd-100, `docs/reference/terminology.md`). Credited as the prompt, not a
  source: every crosswalk citation is to a primary anchor, and the crosswalk's
  admission rule (no single-author coinages, no aggregators) was formulated in
  reaction to it.
- **Agentic Context Engineering (ACE)** — the append-only-delta model of a
  self-improving instruction record, and the two failure modes it names —
  *brevity bias* and *context collapse* — which itd-81 cites to strike itd-5's
  "shorter by >10%" prompt tiebreak.
- **Amazon "Working Backwards"** — the press-release format of abcd's intents.
- **Architecture Decision Records (MADR)** — the shape of the decision record.
- **ccpm (Claude Code PM, Automaze)** — the markdown spec/task conventions
  (PRD → epic → issue, directory-as-store) that abcd's native spec layer is
  convention-compatible with, and the designated deeper backend of the spec
  seam (ADR-24, ADR-26). <https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm>
- **Citation Style Language (CSL-JSON)** — the bibliography format of the
  confidential-sources design (itd-76), whose reserved `custom` field carries
  the confidentiality metadata.
- **Claude Code's permission and sandboxing model** — the posture adr-42 adopts
  for `abcd guard`: an argument-constraining command pattern is documented as
  fragile agent steering rather than a boundary, an unsound pattern is refused
  outright instead of shipped, and the enforcing control sits at the execution
  layer.
  <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions>
- **Conftest (Open Policy Agent)** — the severity→exit-code convention (`0`
  clean / `1` warnings / `2` any error) the `abcd lint` verb adopts for its
  tri-state exit, taken as vocabulary without adopting the Rego engine (itd-85).
- **CriticGPT (OpenAI)** — the injected-bug construction behind itd-81's
  calibration corpus: natural defects are unlabelled, so ground truth is
  manufactured by reintroducing defects whose class is already known.
- **Cursor's terminal command controls** — the decisive negative precedent
  behind adr-42: a shipped command denylist bypassed via `bash -c`, subshells
  and base64, replaced by an allowlist, which was then bypassed by poisoning an
  allowed command's environment, published as GHSA-82wg-qcm4-fp2w /
  CVE-2026-22708 (identifiers as recorded during the iss-272 investigation; the
  advisory host was unreachable when this entry was written). abcd takes the
  lesson, not the mechanism.
  <https://cursor.com/security>
- **DITA subject scheme maps** — the controlled-vocabulary pattern behind the
  persona registry: a field's legal values live in a dedicated registry file
  and a processor flags unbound values (the `persona_registry` lint rule).
- **Diátaxis** — the four-type model behind the user documentation.
- **Domain-Driven Design (bounded contexts)** — the surface boundaries.
- **Doorstop** — the suspect-link fingerprint mechanism adopted for intent
  dependency edges (itd-78), and the store-one-direction/derive-the-reverse
  link model the edge schema follows (shared with OpenFastTrace and
  Sphinx-Needs).
- **GEPA (reflective prompt evolution)** — the score → reflect-on-failing-traces
  → minimal-delta → re-score loop that itd-81 adopts as a human-approved manual
  procedure rather than as a library dependency.
- **Go's embedded build info (`runtime/debug.BuildInfo` VCS stamping)** — the
  source of the running binary's vintage that itd-111's staleness detection
  reads (build revision and the `vcs.modified` dirty flag), with its documented
  stamping holes driving the first-class *unknown* outcome.
- **GTFOBins** — the `shell` / `command` function taxonomy, which names the
  class `abcd guard` is exposed to (a binary that spawns a shell or runs a
  command) and, by its privilege-escalation inclusion criterion, demonstrates
  that no curated list covers abcd's threat: `nice`, `setsid`, `stdbuf` grant no
  privilege and are perfect bypasses (adr-42). <https://gtfobins.github.io>
- **Homebrew's auto-update-on-use and the `update-notifier` pattern (npm)** — the
  UX grammar itd-111 keeps (cached comparison, a gentle nudge, a one-command
  fix) while rejecting their implicit background network check: abcd implements
  the same grammar over disk-only sources, and the network answers only an
  explicit `--check` (adr-38).
- **git's "behind upstream" notice** — the disk-only precedent itd-111 follows:
  a comparison against locally cached refs, refreshed only by an explicit fetch,
  never a background poll.
- **The Linux kernel's coding-assistants policy** — the `Assisted-by:` attribution
  model abcd adopts for AI-assisted commits.
- **mattpocock/skills (Matt Pocock, MIT)** — two adaptations: the
  glossary-file format (each term a frontmattered Markdown file with aliases
  and forbidden synonyms) behind the brief's terminology glossary, and the
  "grill me" frontier-questioning pattern — an interview that advances by
  asking only what the answers so far cannot settle — adapted as the frontier
  rounds of the brief-creation interview (itd-142).
  <https://github.com/mattpocock/skills>
- **OpenAI Codex's sandbox/approval split** — the vocabulary adr-42 borrows for
  naming what a parse layer is: the OS-enforced sandbox is the boundary, the
  approval policy is "a workflow choice layered on top of" it, and the pattern
  engine carries no threat model.
  <https://github.com/openai/codex>
- **Priority inheritance (real-time scheduling)** — the derived-priority rule
  of the intent dependency graph (itd-78): a minor blocker of a major intent
  computes to major.
- **repolinter** — the declarative rule-object schema (`id` / `severity` /
  `where` / `fix` / `policyInfo`) the `abcd lint` rule model adapts as data,
  separate from the evaluator (itd-85). The tool itself is archived and is not a
  dependency.
- **The Rust RFC process** — the required "Prior Art" section on intents.
- **sudo's `NOEXEC` tag and the sudoers(5) shell-escape statement** — thirty
  years of the same job, and the normative form of adr-42's conclusion:
  restricting users to programs that offer no shell escape "is often
  unworkable", so the answer is an execution-layer control that revokes the
  capability, not a list of the programs that hold it.
