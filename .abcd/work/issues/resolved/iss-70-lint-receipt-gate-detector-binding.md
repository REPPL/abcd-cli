The cryptographic-signing half toward full C stays dormant behind release.yml's public-flip gate (recorded in DECISIONS + PR)."

record-lint receipt-gate hardening (VSA gate): checkReceiptGate does not bind a receipt to the gate it attests — one genuine PROMOTE receipt satisfies EVERY required gate by copying it to each path (lint.go:601, C16); ArmReceiptGate keeps committer-editable required_gates when the caller supplies an empty list, fail-open arming (config.go:136, P9); workflowStepNames captures nested name keys (with: name:) as gate step names (lint.go:857, P4). NOTE C16 adds policy.detector to the receipt JSON schema — a record-lint CONTRACT change, surface for maintainer sign-off before landing. Detector: mismatched policy.detector BLOCKED per gate; empty arming fails closed; only step-indent name captured. Corpus: C16, P9, P4.
