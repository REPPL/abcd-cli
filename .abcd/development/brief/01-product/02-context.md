# Context

You did a manual lifeboat from iDelphiZero → iDelphi (`idelphiDev/.work/lifeboat/rescue/extraction.md` is the gold standard). Before rebuilding iDelphi from scratch, you want to automate: (a) **packing** lessons from an in-progress repo into a portable lifeboat artefact, and (b) **unpacking** that artefact to bootstrap a clean rebuild.

abcd ships these user-facing commands:

- **`/abcd:ahoy install`** — install / update abcd in any project (bootstraps configuration, gitignore, marker blocks, PATH symlink). Bare `/abcd:ahoy` shows status+help.
- **`/abcd:disembark to <path>`** — *pack* a lifeboat from the current project to `<path>` (use `home` for current repo's `.abcd/lifeboat/`). Bare `/abcd:disembark` shows status+help; `probe` and `dry-run` sub-verbs preview without writing.
- **`/abcd:embark from <path>`** — *unpack* a lifeboat at `<path>` into a (typically empty) target project (use `home` for current repo's `.abcd/lifeboat/`). Bare `/abcd:embark` shows status+help; `scan` and `probe <path>` sub-verbs discover/inspect without unpacking.
- **`/abcd:launch ship`** — cut a curated release from the single repo (`.abcd/**` excluded from the artifact by packaging), scrub for PII/secrets, stamp the version, update the marketplace entry. Bare `/abcd:launch` shows status+help; `dry-run` sub-verb runs the full pre-flight gate suite without writing the release artifact.
- **`/abcd:intent`** — bare quoted `/abcd:intent "<text>"` is the canonical create (fn-30/itd-46), plus `refine` / `grill` / `plan` / `ship` / `review` / `consistency` / `shape` / `reclassify` / `link` sub-verbs (the `consistency` sub-verb shipped in fn-29 per itd-48, which superseded itd-31). There is no plain `list` sub-verb — it is folded into the bare render per SD001. Manages **intents** (press-release-format intent docs at `.abcd/development/roadmap/intents/{drafts,planned,shipped,disciplines,superseded}/`). `plan` promotes an intent to `planned/` and plans the work as a spec on the native spec store ([adr-26](../../decisions/adrs/0026-native-spec-layer-ccpm-backend.md); the companion harness `ccpm` as the deeper backend); `ship` drives that spec to completion (or the full pipeline if from drafts/); a spec-close hook reconciles standalone/bundle intents planned → shipped automatically on a successful close (fn-28 `intent_lifecycle.reconcile`); disciplines move from drafts/ to disciplines/ on plan and stay there. Bare `/abcd:intent` shows status+help.
- **`/abcd:capture`** — capture / list / promote / resolve / wontfix issues (the structured ledger version of `.work/issues.md`). Issues live at `.abcd/development/activity/issues/{open,resolved,wontfix}/iss-N-<slug>.md`. See itd-4. The cross-corpus synthesist (`/abcd:dredge`) comes in a later phase as itd-25.
- **`/abcd:memory`** — curate a queryable knowledge substrate (`ingest` external sources / `ask` queries / `lint` health-checks) from specs, ADRs, reviews, and memory. See itd-36 and [`05-internals/07-memory.md`](../05-internals/07-memory.md).

**Plus the `intent grill` sub-verb** (sibling of `refine` under `/abcd:intent`):

- **`/abcd:intent grill <itd-N>`** — Socratic-questioning sub-verb that stress-tests an intent (or brief section, via `--brief-section <id>`) before planning, surfacing unstated assumptions and emerging glossary terms. Sibling of `/abcd:intent refine` (gentle / user-driven). See itd-27.

**The pack/unpack model:**

Lifeboats are portable directories; share by copy/tar/git, not by global archive. **The lifeboat is always *output*** — `.abcd/lifeboat/` in any repo is the latest disembark snapshot, regenerable from current state. Embark/disembark provenance and history live separately at `.abcd/development/voyage/` (see [`02-constraints/01-platform.md`](../02-constraints/01-platform.md) and [`04-surfaces/03-embark.md § 7`](../04-surfaces/03-embark.md#7-voyage-layout-embarkdisembark-provenance-and-history)); the lifeboat itself never accumulates past versions.

**Repo:**

- abcd lives in **one repository** ([adr-28](../../decisions/adrs/0028-single-repo-curated-release.md)) — this directory. The Go binary, its user documentation, and the design record share one tree; `.abcd/**` stays in-tree but is excluded from the curated release artifact by packaging. `/abcd:launch ship` cuts that release from this repo, and the repo is the marketplace. There is no dev→public mirror. `abcdSubZero/` (an earlier CLI) is skimmed in Phase 0 for patterns to learn from — reference only, not a port target.

**Validation corpus:** user-maintained list in `.abcd/corpus.json`, seeded with:

- `idelphiDev/` (primary) — a mature spec corpus, a large transcript history, manual lifeboat present
- `abcdSubZero/` — a lightweight codebase with sparse specs and lighter docs (exercises adapter graceful-degradation)
- `idelphiSubZero/` — likely sparse on transcripts and specs (exercises Pass A with thin inputs, code-rescuer leaning on source)

Per-phase acceptance runs against the corpus with documented exemptions where a feature genuinely doesn't apply (e.g., the spec-essence pass on a repo with no spec store emits an empty `spec-essence.json` — the oracle should note and pass).
