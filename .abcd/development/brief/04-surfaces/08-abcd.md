# `/abcd` — Top-Level Where-Am-I Status Board

The bare top-level `/abcd` command (no sub-verb) is the cross-command
re-orientation surface (itd-20): type `/abcd` and see, at a glance, where you
left off across the whole abcd setup. It is STRICTLY read-only — the render
module `scripts/abcd/status_render.py` opens files for reading only and never
writes.

This is the top-level command (`commands/abcd.md`), distinct from the
per-verb bare renders (`/abcd:intent`, `/abcd:ahoy`, …). Each per-verb bare
render is scoped to its own command's surface; this board is the *cross-verb*
answer to "what's the state of my abcd project right now?".

## Sub-verbs and aliases

Bare `/abcd` renders the six-section board. `status` and `help` are
POSITIONAL ALIAS tokens that route to the SAME render — their output is
byte-identical to bare `/abcd`.

| Token | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| *(bare)* | Render the six-section where-am-i board |
| `status` | Alias — byte-identical to bare |
| `help` | Alias — byte-identical to bare (bare-as-render IS the help) |

Any other token is refused (exit 2); the alias surface is a closed set.

## SD001 alias rationale (investigation-gated)

The [SD001 rule](../02-constraints/04-naming.md) (`02-constraints/04-naming.md`,
the "Bare-command-as-render discipline" + "Forbidden sub-verbs" sections) was
read for this task. Its explicit forbidden set is `show` / `stats` / plain
`list` / `view` — sub-verbs that *name what bare already renders*. `status`
and `help` are NOT in that forbidden set, and the rule's spirit ("a sub-verb
must earn its existence by doing something bare cannot") is satisfied by
treating `status` and `help` as **aliases, not sub-verbs**: they route to the
identical bare render and add no distinct behaviour. They exist only so the
intuitive `/abcd status` / `/abcd help` land on the same board — improving
discoverability, which is exactly what SD001 protects. The alias tokens
therefore satisfy SD001 rather than tripping it. (Had they instead introduced
divergent behaviour, they would be forbidden sub-verbs and the design would be
reconsidered — the gate is real, not a rubber stamp.)

## fn-17 stub replacement (investigation-gated)

itd-20 was planned assuming a fn-17 probe stub for the bare top-level command
would be *replaced*. Investigation found NO such stub: fn-17 shipped
probe/bare renders for the *sub-verb* surfaces (`/abcd:disembark`,
`/abcd:embark`, `/abcd:launch`, and a verification of bare `/abcd:intent`) —
never a top-level `commands/abcd.md`. `git log` confirms `commands/abcd.md`
has never existed. This task therefore CREATES the top-level command fresh
rather than replacing a stub; the "stub replacement" premise is recorded here
as not-applicable so a later reader does not hunt for a stub that was never
shipped.

## The six sections (fixed order)

The render emits exactly these six sections, always in this order. Each
source is a local-filesystem read; each source's absence maps to a NAMED
known-state line (never an exception, never a silent omission).

1. **Project + visibility** — project name (the cwd's directory name) and
   `repo.visibility` from `.abcd/config.json`.
2. **Lifeboat presence / age** — the `.abcd/lifeboat/` directory's mtime,
   rendered as an age in days with a staleness flag.
3. **Dev-sync staleness** — v1 terminal known-state line (see below).
4. **Recent logbook** — the last five logbook ENTRIES by mtime. The logbook
   is organised `<category>/<entry>` (e.g. `grill/20260701T000000Z-itd-67`),
   so the render descends exactly ONE bounded level into each category
   directory and lists entries labelled `<category>/<name>`; loose files at
   the logbook root are entries in their own right. Two levels total — never
   a recursive walk. Fewer than five → render what exists with a count.
5. **Active intents** — intents in `intents/planned/` and `intents/shipped/`
   that carry a linked `spec_id` whose spec is NOT `done`, rendered with the
   spec status read via the `scripts/ralph/flowctl` dispatcher.
6. **Suggested next actions** — a short bullet list keyed off the state above.

## Per-source known-state table

| Source | Absent / unreadable → known-state line |
|--------|----------------------------------------|
| `.abcd/` directory | outside-abcd guidance message (single line, replaces the whole board) |
| `repo.visibility` in `.abcd/config.json` | `visibility: unknown (no repo.visibility in config)` |
| `.abcd/lifeboat/` | `lifeboat: never packed — run /abcd:disembark when ready` |
| dev-sync last-run artifact | `dev-sync: no dev-sync record …` (v1 terminal — see below) |
| `.abcd/logbook/` (empty / unreadable) | `logbook: no entries yet` |
| linked intents (none with a live spec) | `intents: no planned or active intents with a linked spec` |
| spec status via flowctl (missing / fail / timeout / unparseable) | `unknown` |

## Staleness thresholds (decided here)

| Signal | Threshold | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Lifeboat age → `(stale)` | 7 days | A point-in-time rescue snapshot a week old warrants a re-pack cue without nagging on daily work. |
| Dev-sync staleness | n/a (v1) | No durable last-run artifact exists — see below. |

## Dev-sync source (probed, recorded — v1 terminal stub)

`scripts/abcd/dev_sync.py` exposes the `abcd dev-sync work` migration surface
(`.work/issues.md` → the structured `iss-N` ledger). It is **migration logic,
not a durable last-run timestamp**: no config field and no history-store
record captures "when dev-sync last ran". No such artifact exists anywhere in
the repo.

Therefore section (3) is PERMANENTLY the `no dev-sync record` known-state line
in v1 — the dev-sync-staleness signal does **not** function until a state
substrate exists. This is an ALLOWED terminal state, recorded here and in the
itd-20 intent so it is not read as a shipped capability. Adding a dev-sync
state substrate is explicitly OUT of scope for fn-83.2 (and named in the .5
out-of-scope update).

## Performance bounds (NFR)

- Bounded directory reads only — `.abcd/logbook/` is read to a depth of two
  (category → entry) and the two named intent directories to a depth of one;
  NO recursive full-tree scans.
- Last-N sorting only (logbook capped at 5, active intents capped at 10) — no
  full-history loads.
- The flowctl spec-status read runs under a 5-second timeout; expiry maps to
  the `unknown` status line so a slow dispatcher never wedges the render.

## Zero-writes guarantee

The command markdown performs zero writes; the render module performs zero
writes. This is proven by two tests: a static zero-mutation lint over
`scripts/abcd/status_render.py` and an fs-snapshot test that asserts a render
over a populated fixture repo mutates nothing at run time.
