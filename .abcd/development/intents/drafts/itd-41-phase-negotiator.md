# abcd Tells You, Honestly, What a Phasing Choice Costs

## Press Release

> **abcd proposes how to phase your roadmap and shows you the real trade-offs before you commit.** Ask abcd to phase a set of intents and it works backwards from what each phase should make true, proposes an ordered set of phases, and then — instead of letting your wish-list go unchallenged — it interrogates the plan with you. Pull an intent forward and it asks which phase's expectation now slips; defer one and it names, from the dependency graph, exactly what else waits. Every cost it states is traced to a real dependency edge or a real phase-acceptance bullet — it never invents a trade-off to sound thorough. You still decide; abcd makes sure you decide knowing the price.
>
> "I always want everything in phase one," said Carol, product lead. "abcd asked me — move `itd-3` later and what in phase two stops working? I hadn't thought about the rules loader. It didn't lecture me; it asked the question the dependency graph already implied, and then it showed me the one phase-acceptance bullet I'd quietly broken. I re-scoped in five minutes, with my eyes open."

## Why This Matters

[adr-9](../../decisions/adrs/0009-phase-as-product-layer.md) made the **phase** abcd's sequencing layer — an ordered stretch of work, bundling intents and plumbing, ending in a milestone, with a product-authored `## Expectation` and `## Phase Acceptance`. But adr-9 gave sequencing a *home*, not a *negotiator*. Which intent goes in which phase, and in what order phases run, stays the product thinker's unchallenged judgement.

The product thinker holds the whole product in their head — and so they want everything, soon. abcd has adversarial readers at every other grain: `/abcd:intent grill` interrogates an intent before it is planned; dual-backend review stress-tests a spec; `intent-fidelity-reviewer` checks delivered reality against acceptance. The phase-planning grain has none. This intent adds it.

The danger is a fluent fake. An agent asked "what are the trade-offs?" will invent plausible ones, and a hallucinated trade-off spends the product thinker's trust on a fiction. So this intent's negotiator works the way `intent-fidelity-reviewer` and the grill skill work — **Socratic where it questions, grounded where it asserts** (per [adr-10](../../decisions/adrs/0010-phase-negotiator-grounded-tradeoffs.md)). It surfaces costs the product thinker can verify, and asks — rather than asserts — wherever it cannot ground the claim.

## What's In Scope

- **Phase proposal** — given a set of intents (and the relevant brief plumbing-phases), the negotiator works backwards from candidate `## Expectation`s and proposes an ordered set of phases, each with a draft `## Expectation`, `## Milestone`, and `## Phase Acceptance` for the product thinker to take, edit, or reject.
- **Trade-off discussion — Socratic interface.** The negotiator interrogates the proposed (or product-thinker-edited) phasing with questions, each tagged with a named Socratic move, the same taxonomy `/abcd:intent grill` uses. The product thinker's answers surface the trade-offs.
- **Grounded assertions only.** Where the negotiator states a cost rather than asking, the statement MUST cite a real anchor: a named edge in the dependency DAG (`brief/06-delivery/01-build-sequence.md` + intent/spec dependency declarations), a named `## Phase Acceptance` bullet, or a named `## Expectation` clause. A concern with no such anchor is raised as a question, never as an asserted trade-off.
- **Re-sequencing analysis** — the negotiator can take an existing phase plan and a proposed change (pull intent forward / defer / split a phase) and report, grounded in the DAG, what the change ripples into.
- **Advisory output** — the deliverable is a proposal plus a recorded discussion, not a decision. The product thinker owns the final `## Expectation` and `## Phase Acceptance` per adr-9.

## What's Out of Scope

- **Deciding the phase plan** — the negotiator never commits a phasing. It proposes and discusses; the product thinker decides and authors the canonical phase docs.
- **Ungrounded trade-offs** — if a cost cannot be tied to a DAG edge or an acceptance/expectation clause, it is not asserted. "Sounds thorough" is not a licence to invent.
- **Replacing the grill skill** — grill operates on a single intent pre-plan; the negotiator operates on phases and their ordering. Shared Socratic lineage, different surface (per adr-10 alternative 4).
- **Estimating effort or dates** — the negotiator reasons about dependencies and acceptance, not durations. No time estimates (per the workspace no-estimates rule).
- **Auto-authoring phase docs** — it drafts proposals; writing the canonical `roadmap/phases/phase-N-*.md` files is the product thinker's act.

## Acceptance Criteria

> _BDD format, per the itd-1 discipline._

- **Given** a set of intents and the relevant plumbing-phases, **when** the product thinker asks abcd to phase them, **then** abcd proposes an ordered set of phases, each with a draft `## Expectation` and `## Phase Acceptance`, and presents it as a proposal to edit or reject — not as a committed plan.
- **Given** a proposed phasing, **when** the negotiator raises a trade-off as an assertion, **then** the assertion cites a specific dependency-DAG edge, `## Phase Acceptance` bullet, or `## Expectation` clause; an assertion with no such citation is a defect.
- **Given** a concern the negotiator cannot ground in a DAG edge or an acceptance/expectation clause, **when** it surfaces that concern, **then** it is phrased as a Socratic question tagged with a named move — never as an asserted trade-off.
- **Given** the product thinker proposes pulling an intent into an earlier phase, **when** the negotiator analyses the change, **then** it names, from the dependency graph, every item whose dependency chain is affected, and names which `## Phase Acceptance` bullet of the affected phase is put at risk.
- **Given** the negotiator has finished, **when** the product thinker reviews the output, **then** the phase plan is unchanged on disk until the product thinker authors it — the negotiator's output is advisory.

## Open Questions

- Surface shape — is this a sub-verb of a phase-oriented command, a sub-verb under `/abcd:intent` (alongside `grill`), or its own command? adr-10 leaves the surface to this intent; it needs deciding at plan time.
- Should the negotiator's discussion be persisted (a logbook artefact, like grill reports) so a phase doc can cite the negotiation that shaped it?
- How does the negotiator behave when the dependency DAG is prose-only for some area — degrade to pure Socratic questioning (adr-10's stated limit), or prompt the product thinker to formalise that DAG slice first?
- Does the negotiator share a Socratic-move taxonomy module with the grill skill, or keep its own copy until the two demonstrably converge?

## Audit Notes

_Empty. Populated by intent-fidelity-reviewer when intent moves to shipped/._

## References

- Shares the grounded-adversary pattern with: `itd-42` (coherence-aware grill) — both are *Socratic where they question, grounded where they assert*; a concern with no anchor is asked, never asserted.
