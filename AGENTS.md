## abcd rule loader

This repository uses the abcd modular rules loader. On `UserPromptSubmit`, a hook
recall-matches the prompt against keyword triggers declared in the plugin-bundled
default domains and `<repo>/.abcd/rules.json`, and injects only the matched
domain rules into context — instead of force-loading the full ruleset every turn.
A prompt that matches no domain injects nothing (zero added tokens).

- Inspect rules: `abcd rules` renders the active set; `abcd rules <DOMAIN>`
  (case-insensitive) scopes to one domain.
- Per-repo overrides: edit `<repo>/.abcd/rules.json`. It is
  `{"schema_version": 1, "disabled": false, "domains": {}}` — add a domain key to
  override a default per-field (e.g. `{"ROADMAP": {"state": "dormant"}}` silences
  it while keeping its rules) or to declare a custom domain
  (`{"recall": [...], "rules": [...]}`).
- Kill switch: set `"disabled": true` at the top of `.abcd/rules.json`.
- Explicit activation: start a prompt with `*<DOMAIN>` (e.g. `*COMMITTING`,
  `*PII`) to inject that domain unconditionally — overrides a `dormant` state,
  but never the kill switch.

### Default domains

`COMMITTING`, `DOCUMENTATION`, `ROADMAP`, `ISSUES`, `INTENTS`, `LIFEBOAT`, `PII`,
`OPINIONS`. Each carries recall keywords and its rules, bundled in the abcd
binary; a repo overrides them per-field via `.abcd/rules.json`. `OPINIONS`
points at the canonical conventions under `.abcd/development/principles/` rather
than copying them.

### Reset triggers

`SessionStart` and `PreCompact` clear the per-session dedup ledger, so a matched
domain re-injects on the next prompt (the event-driven refresh that recovers
after compaction). Within a session the hook does not re-inject unchanged rules.

For internals see `.abcd/development/brief/05-internals/03-configuration.md`.

<!-- END ABCD -->

abcd (Agent-Based Configuration for Development) is a Go CLI and an agent-harness
plugin: a host-agnostic **configuration layer for intent-driven development**. A single
`abcd` binary holds all behaviour in a transport-agnostic core; the CLI, the
markdown plugin surface, and (later) an MCP server are thin front doors onto it.

Start with the plan and the design record:

- Design record (the specification): [`.abcd/development/`](.abcd/development/) —
  brief, roadmap, intents, decisions/adrs, research.
- Package map: [`internal/README.md`](internal/README.md).

## Build, test, and checks

Run from the repo root.

```bash
make preflight      # the pre-push gate: lint-reviews + record-lint + docs-lint,
                    # then build + vet + test + race (internal)
make build          # cross-compiles bin/abcd-<goos>-<arch> (there is no plain bin/abcd)
gofmt -l .          # format gate: any output names a file needing `gofmt -w`
go vet ./...        # static checks
go test ./...       # unit tests
go test ./internal/core/                 # a single package
go test -run TestStatus ./internal/core/ # a single test
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs its `check` job on macOS + Linux — build,
vet, test and the race-enabled internal tests on both, with the `gofmt -l .`
format gate and the record-lint and docs-lint steps on the Linux leg alone.
Separate jobs run the reviews-charter check (`scripts/check-reviews.sh`),
full-history secret scanning (`gitleaks`), a workflow audit (`zizmor`),
dependency review, `govulncheck`, and the smoke harness (`make smoke`). A
fail-closed classifier stands the macOS leg, the race lane and the `zizmor`,
`govulncheck` and smoke jobs down on a pull request confined to `docs/`,
`.abcd/development/`, `.abcd/work/` and the root prose files; the Linux unit
lane, the format gate and the record gates always run, and every other event —
the merge-queue entry that gates the merge included — runs the lot.

## Working-tree layout (three tiers under `.abcd/`)

Development material lives under `.abcd/`; `docs/` is user-facing only.

- `.abcd/development/` — **durable record** (committed): brief, intents, ADRs,
  plans, research. In every repository checkout; not in the released binaries.
- `.abcd/work/` — **shared working** (committed): `CONTEXT.md` (current
  orientation) and `DECISIONS.md` (append-only decision log; architecture-shaping
  decisions graduate to ADRs under `.abcd/development/decisions/adrs/`), plus the
  issue ledger `issues/` (working-tier data per adr-32), the reviews charter
  `reviews/`, and the branch-ruleset mirror `rulesets/`.
- `.abcd/.work.local/` — **local ephemeral** (gitignored): `NEXT.md` handover,
  `scratch/`, `logs/`. Per-worktree, so it never merge-conflicts.

**Default to the local tier when in doubt.** Any artefact whose home is unclear —
tool exports, oracle/review output, traces, intermediate analysis — goes to
`.abcd/.work.local/scratch/` (or `logs/` for run output) **first**. Never to the
repo root, and never into a tracked directory on a guess. Promotion is cheap and
always available: an artefact that proves durable is moved up to `.abcd/work/` or
`.abcd/development/` later, in a change that says why. Demotion is not — an
artefact committed to the wrong tier is already in the history, and a stray
top-level directory is a `stray_root_docs` finding. **Guessing upward is
irreversible; guessing downward costs nothing.**

## Boundaries

- **Transport-agnostic core.** `internal/core` never writes to stdout or knows a
  transport; front doors under `internal/surface/*` format its results.
- **Wired or it isn't done.** Every verb is reachable from both the CLI and the
  plugin markdown surface and demonstrably executes there — no dead scaffolding.
- **Host-delegated by default.** LLM review/agent work is delegated to the host;
  native/CLI/API/MCP oracles are opt-in adapters.
- **Single repo, curated release.** `.abcd/**` stays in-tree and is present in
  every repository checkout — marketplace installs and release source archives
  included — never in the released binaries; the launch bundler denies the
  namespace structurally, though that filter has yet to run on a cut release.
  The repo is the plugin marketplace.
- **Never commit or push without being asked.** Substantive work goes on a branch
  and PR; new dependencies need explicit sign-off before `go get`.

## Concurrent sessions

- **The checkout is the unit of isolation, not the branch.** A second
  concurrent agent session works in its own `git worktree`: one checkout has
  one working tree, one HEAD, and one index, and a branch switch swaps all
  three under whoever else is using them. The lint gates read the whole tree,
  so foreign work-in-progress fails them in both directions.
- **Scan before mutating git state.** Before a commit, branch switch, stash,
  or rebase in a checkout that might be shared, check for peer sessions via
  the harness's session listing, and announce the mutation to any peer found.
- **A diff you did not make is a peer's work.** Never commit it, revert it,
  or stash it away silently — coordinate with the session that made it;
  uncommitted peer work is untouchable. (Mechanical presence detection is
  seeded as iss-2608220750029993; until it ships, this convention is the
  gate.)
- **Isolation protects the tree, not the sequential record ids.** Intents and
  specs still mint `max+1` under a lock that is advisory and scoped to one
  checkout, so it cannot see a sibling worktree: Two current checkouts
  minting in the same window allocate the same id by construction, and being
  up to date does not help. Say which family you are about to mint into, or
  mint from one checkout. The durable fix is the timestamp mint that captures
  already use (iss-2608210737260468, with the collision paths recorded as
  iss-2608220150157512 and iss-2608221126066632); this note is a caveat, not
  a remedy.

## Definition of done

- `make preflight` is clean — the three lint gates (`lint-reviews`,
  `record-lint`, `docs-lint`) plus `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`,
  `go test ./...`, and `go test -race ./internal/...`.
- `gofmt -l .` reports nothing. The format gate is CI's own step, outside
  `make preflight`, so run it before pushing.
- Every new behaviour has a test watched fail before the change and pass after.
- A CHANGELOG entry accompanies any user-facing change.

## Attribution and acknowledgements

- **AI-assisted commits carry an `Assisted-by:` trailer**, kernel format
  (`Assisted-by: Claude:claude-opus-4-8`) — disclosure, not authorship. Never
  `Co-Authored-By:` for AI (it asserts an authorship the tool does not hold and
  inflates the contributor graph). There is no DCO: contributions are inbound =
  outbound MIT, so no `Signed-off-by:` is required (adr-43). The human is the
  author of record, responsible for all AI-assisted output. See `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **A human-only change declares itself: `Assisted-by: None`.** The convention is
  disclosure, and work no AI touched has nothing to disclose — but silence cannot
  say so, because an absent trailer and a forgotten one are the same bytes. The
  declaration is the positive form, and it is the only accepted non-vendor value:
  a free-text escape would reopen the omission it closes. Claiming it for assisted
  work is a false disclosure, which is the thing this convention exists to prevent.
- **Naming a tool is confined to credit.** User-facing prose (`README.md`,
  `docs/`) stays host-agnostic — the `harness/*` docs-lint rules enforce it. The
  one sanctioned place to name a tool is attribution: the README badge and
  `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md`, using the `<!-- docs-lint: allow -->` escape where a lint
  root is involved. Private, unpublished tool names never appear in any committed
  file.
- **`ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md`** credits ideas, tools, and writing in three parts —
  development, inspirations, references. Add an entry in the same change that lands
  it (adopts a pattern, cites a source in an ADR, integrates a tool), never later.
